## Description

A simple profile app that allows the user to add and edit their nickname
As well as their profile picture
The images are stored in AWS s3

I built this to learn and demonstrate the use of API's in react,
Building a backend server and database with mongoDB,
Using AWS S3 storage for images, 
Understanding the benefits of both local storag and redux store simutaneously,
While both persist data and connect data from different points, 
the main difference for me, 
If a user refreshes, local storage will still keep the data there.
While Redux store can hold different default values. 
The app will run on a single command. I could have done it through npm scripts in package.json,
However, I decided to incorporate a bash script to demonstrate a differnt way.
Typically npm scripts would be enough, but it this app were scale up,
and there were more pieces to run, a bash script may be more useful. 

Next, I'd lke to dockerize the app, creating one container for it. 

Issues to learn from and remember: 
1. nickName wasn’t being read in local storage, wasn’t being read after refresh, 
store was getting re-initialized 
2. fileUpload issue, looked at what the error was, saw it was trying to render imageFile, 
looked at application state, saw nickName had updated instead of imageFile in local storage. 
trying to update two different files, but only updating nickName, 
then had to create [key] to switch which would be updated, and since one was a string one was an object, (different data types). 
I had to make a condition to check for it. 
but then, saving imageFile in imageFile, (nested object), so I had to remove one of the nested objects
